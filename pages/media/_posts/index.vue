                            St John Ambulance Logistics North West have been working with PPS to create a shelter suitable for the large events they attend. St John Ambulance volunteers provide first aid in their communities, keeping people safe at events, and working alongside the NHS in response to 999 calls. </p>
                        <p class=" py-2">
                            Using the standard Rapid Pro 50 – 9 the Logistics team worked with the PPS Technical team to create a customary shelter purpose built for St John Ambulance. It includes removable doors, rain flaps, a change in window design and a connection strip to connect more than one Rapid Pro 50 – 9 together. </p>
                        <p class="py-2">
                            Staff from PPS, delivered the shelter to St John Ambulance North West and also trained volunteers on how to use it. The Rapid Pro 50 – 9 was well received by all volunteers who could all see that the changes would help them deliver the care needed when out at events.
